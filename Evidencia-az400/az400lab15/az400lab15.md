Set up an Azure DevOps organization
If you don’t already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at Create an organization or project collection.

##Exercise 1: Configure the lab prerequisites
In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisites for the lab, which consist of a team project based on an Azure DevOps Demo Generator template and Azure resources, including an Azure App Service web app, an Azure Container Registry instance, and an Azure SQL database.

###Task 1: Configure the team project
In this task, you will use Azure DevOps Demo Generator to generate a new project based on the Docker template.

Note: The Docker template-based project builds and deploys a containerized ASP.NET Core app to Azure App Service

On your lab computer, start a web browser and navigate to Azure DevOps Demo Generator. This utility site will automate the process of creating a new Azure DevOps project within your account that is prepopulated with content (work items, repos, etc.) required for the lab.

Note: For more information on the site, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/demo-gen.

Click Sign in and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure DevOps subscription.
If required, on the Azure DevOps Demo Generator page, click Accept to accept the permission requests for accessing your Azure DevOps subscription.
On the Create New Project page, in the New Project Name textbox, type Deploying Docker containers to Azure App Service web apps, in the Select organization dropdown list, select your Azure DevOps organization, and then click Choose template.
In the list of templates, in the toolbar, click DevOps Labs, select the DevOps Labs header, click the Docker template, and then click Select Template.
Back on the Create New Project page, if prompted to install missing extensions, select the checkbox below the Docker Integration label and click Create Project.

Note: Wait for the process to complete. This should take about 2 minutes. In case the process fails, navigate to your DevOps organization, delete the project, and try again.

On the Create New Project page, click Navigate to project.

###Task 2: Create Azure resources
In this task, you will use Azure Cloud Shell to create Azure resources required in this lab:

Azure Container Registry
Azure Web App for Containers
Azure SQL Database
From the lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the Azure Portal, and sign in with the user account that has the Owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab and has the role of the Global Administrator in the Azure AD tenant associated with this subscription.
In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, in the toolbar, click the Cloud Shell icon located directly to the right of the search text box.
If prompted to select either Bash or PowerShell, select Bash.

Note: If this is the first time you are starting Cloud Shell and you are presented with the You have no storage mounted message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select Create storage.

From the Bash session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create variables representing the Azure region where you will deploy resources in this lab, the resource group containing these resources, as well as the names of these resources, including an Azure Container Registry instance, an Azure App Service plan name, an Azure web app name, an Azure SQL Database logical server name, and an Azure SQL database name:

From the Bash session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the resource group that will host Azure resources you deploy in this lab (replace the <Azure_region> placeholder with the name of the Azure region, such as ‘eastus’, where you intend to deploy these resources):

Code
LOCATION=<Azure_region>
Note: You can identify Azure region names by running az account list-locations -o table

Run the following to create variables representing the names of Azure resources, including an Azure Container Registry instance, an Azure App Service plan name, an Azure web app name, an Azure SQL Database logical server name, and an Azure SQL database name:

Code
RG_NAME='az400m1501a-RG'
ACR_NAME=az400m151acr$RANDOM$RANDOM
APP_SVC_PLAN='az400m1501a-app-svc-plan'
WEB_APP_NAME=az400m151web$RANDOM$RANDOM
SQLDB_SRV_NAME=az400m15sqlsrv$RANDOM$RANDOM
SQLDB_NAME='az400m15sqldb'
Note: You can identify Azure region names by running az account list-locations -o table

Run the following to create all resources required Azure resources required for this lab:

Code
az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION
az acr create --name $ACR_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION --sku Standard --admin-enabled true
az appservice plan create --name 'az400m1501a-app-svc-plan' --location $LOCATION --resource-group $RG_NAME --is-linux
az webapp create --name $WEB_APP_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --plan $APP_SVC_PLAN --deployment-container-image-name elnably/dockerimagetest
IMAGE_NAME=myhealth.web
az webapp config container set --name $WEB_APP_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --docker-custom-image-name $IMAGE_NAME --docker-registry-server-url $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/$IMAGE_NAME:latest --docker-registry-server-url https://$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io
az sql server create --name $SQLDB_SRV_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION --admin-user sqladmin --admin-password Pa55w.rd1234
az sql db create --name $SQLDB_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --server $SQLDB_SRV_NAME --service-objective S0 --no-wait
az sql server firewall-rule create --name AllowAllAzure --resource-group $RG_NAME --server $SQLDB_SRV_NAME --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
Note: Wait for the provisioning process to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

Run the following to configure a connection string of the newly created Azure web app (replace the $SQLDB_SRV_NAME and $SQLDB_NAME placeholders with the values of the names of the Azure SQL Database logical server and its database instance, respectively):

Code
CONNECTION_STRING="Data Source=tcp:$SQLDB_SRV_NAME.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=$SQLDB_NAME;User Id=sqladmin;Password=Pa55w.rd1234;"
az webapp config connection-string set --name $WEB_APP_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --connection-string-type SQLAzure --settings defaultConnection="$CONNECTION_STRING"
In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane, navigate to the Resource groups blade, and, on the Resource groups blade, select the az400m1501a-RG entry.
On the az400m1501a-RG resource group blade, review the listing of its resources.

Note: Record the name of the logical Azure SQL Database server. You will need it later in this lab.

On the az400m1501a-RG resource group blade, in the list of resources, click the entry representing the Container Registry instance.
On the container registry blade, in the vertical menu on the left side, in the Settings section, click Access keys.
On the Access keys blade of the container registry instance, identify the values of the Registry name, Login server, Admin user, and password entries.

Note: Record the Registry name, Login server, and password entries (the registry names and the admin user name should match). You will need it later in this lab.

##Exercise 2: Deploy a Docker container to Azure App Service web app by using Azure DevOps
In this exercise, you will deploy a Docker container to Azure App Service web app by using Azure DevOps.

###Task 1: Configure Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)
In this task, you will use the Azure DevOps project you generated in the previous exercise in order to implement a CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys a Docker container to an Azure App Service web app.

On your lab computer, switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal with the Deploying Docker containers to Azure App Service web apps project open, in the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, click Pipelines.

Note: You will first modify the build pipeline.

On the Pipelines pane, click the entry representing the MHCDocker.build pipeline and, on the MHCDocker.build pane, click Edit.

Note: The build pipeline consists of the following tasks

Tasks Usage
Run services prepares the build environment by restoring the required packages
Build services builds the myhealth.web image
Push services pushes the myhealth.web image tagged with $(Build.BuildId) to container registry
Publish Artifact allows for sharing dacpac for database deployment through Azure DevOps artifacts
On the MHCDocker.build pipeline pane, in the list of tasks of the pipeline, click the Run services task, on the Docker Compose pane on the right side, in the Azure subscription dropdown list, select the entry representing the Azure subscription you are using in this lab, and click Authorize to create the corresponding service connection. When prompted, sign in using the account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription and the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription.

Note: This step creates an Azure service connection, which defines and secures a connection to the target Azure subscription, using Service Principal Authentication (SPA).

In the list of tasks of the pipeline, with the Run services task selected, on the Docker Compose pane on the right side, in the Azure Container Registry dropdown list, select the entry representing the ACR instance you created earlier in this lab (refresh the list if needed or type the name of the login server).
Repeat the previous two steps to configure the Azure subscription and Azure Container Registry settings in the Build services, and Push services tasks, but, this time, instead of selecting your Azure subscription, select the newly created service connection.
On the same MHCDocker.build pipeline pane, at the top of the pane, click the down-facing caret next to the Save & queue button, click Save to save the changes, and, when prompted again, click Save.

Note: Next you will modify the release pipeline.

In the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, in the Pipelines section, click Releases.
On the Pipelines / Releases pane, ensure that the MHCDocker.release entry is selected and click Edit.
On the All pipelines / MHCDocker.release pane, in the rectangle representing the Dev stage of the deployment, click the 2 jobs, 2 tasks link.

Note: The release pipeline consists of the following tasks

Tasks Usage
Execute Azure SQL: DacpacTask deploys the dacpac artifact including the target schema and data to the Azure SQL database
Azure App Service deploy pulls the docker image generated during the build stage from the designated container registry and deploys the image to the Azure App Service web app
In the list of tasks of the pipeline, click the Execute Azure SQL: DacpacTask task, on the Azure SQL Database deployment pane on the right side, in the Azure subscription dropdown list, select the entry representing the Azure service connection you created earlier in this task.
In the list of tasks of the pipeline, click the Azure App Service deploy task, on the Azure App Service deploy pane on the right side, in the Azure subscription dropdown list, select the entry representing the Azure service connection you created earlier in this task and, in the App Service name dropdown list, select the entry representing the Azure App Service web app you deployed earlier in this lab.

Note: Next you will need to configure the agent pool information required for deployment.

Select the DB deployment job, on the Agent job pane on the right side, in the Agent pool dropdown list, select Azure Pipelines and, next, in the Agent Specification dropdown list, select vs2017-win2016.
Select the Web App deployment job, on the Agent job pane on the right side, in the Agent pool dropdown list, select Azure Pipelines and, next, in the Agent Specification dropdown list, select ubuntu-16.04.
At the top of the pane, click the Variables header.
In the list of pipeline variables, set the values of the following variables:

Variable Value
ACR Azure container registry login name you recorded in the previous exercise of this lab, including the azurecr.io suffix
DatabaseName az400m15sqldb
Password Pa55w.rd1234
SQLadmin sqladmin
SQLserver the name of the Azure SQL Database logical server you recorded in the previous exercise of this lab, including the database.windows.net suffix
In the upper right corner of the pane, click the Save button to save the changes, and, when prompted again, click Save.
