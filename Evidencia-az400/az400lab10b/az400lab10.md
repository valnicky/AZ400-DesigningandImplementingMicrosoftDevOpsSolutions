##Exercise 1: Create a release dashboard
In this exercise, you will create a release dashboard in an Azure DevOps organization.

###Task 1: Create an Azure DevOps Starter resource
In this task, you will create an Azure DevOps Starter resource in your Azure subscription. This will automatically create a corresponding project in your Azure DevOps organization.

On your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the Azure Portal and sign in with the user account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
In the Azure portal, search for and select the DevOps Starter resource type and, on the DevOps Starter blade, click + Add.
On the DevOps Starter blade, on the Start fresh with a new application pane, select the .NET tile and on the tops next to Setting up DevOps starter with GitHub, change settings, click here and select Azure DevOps , Done and Next: Framework >.
On the DevOps Starter blade, on the Choose an application framework pane, select the **ASP.NET Core** tile, move the **Add a database** slider to the **On** position, and click **Next: Service >**.
On the DevOps Starter blade, on the Select an Azure service to deploy the application pane, ensure that the Windows Web App tile is selected and click Next: Create >.
On the DevOps Starter blade, on the Almost there pane, specify the following settings:

Setting Value
Project name Creating a Release Dashboard
Azure DevOps Organization the name of the Azure DevOps organization you intend to use in this lab
Subscription the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab
Web app name any globally unique string between 2 and 60 characters consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, starting and ending with either a letter or a digit
Location the name of Azure region into which you intend to deploy an Azure web app and an Azure SQL database
On the DevOps Starter blade, on the Almost there pane, click Additional settings.
On the Additional settings pane, specify the following settings and click OK.

Setting Value
Create new Azure DevOps organization No
Resource group az400m10l02-rg
Pricing tier S1 Standard
Application Insights Location the name of the same Azure region that you chose for the location of the Azure web app
Server name any globally unique string between 3 and 63 characters consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, starting and ending with either a letter or a digit
Enter username dbadmin
Location the name of the same Azure region that you chose for the location of the Azure web app
Database Name az400m10l02-db
Back on the DevOps Starter blade, on the Almost there pane, click Done and then Review+Create.

Note: Wait for the deployment to complete. The provisioning of the DevOps Starter resource should take about 2 minutes.

Once you receive the confirmation that the DevOps Starter resource was provisioned, click the Go to resource button. This will redirect the browser to the DevOps Starter blade.
On the DevOps Starter blade, track the progress of CI/CD pipeline until it completes successfully.

Note: The creation of the corresponding Azure web app and Azure SQL database might take about 5 minutes. The process automatically creates an Azure DevOps project that includes a ready-to-deploy repository as well as the build and release pipelines. The Azure resources are created as part of the automatically triggered deployment pipeline.

###Task 2: Create Azure DevOps releases
In this task, you will create several Azure DevOps releases, including one that will result in a failed deployment.

In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, on the DevOps Starter page, in the toolbar, click Project homepage. This will automatically open another browser tab displaying the Creating a Release Dashboard project in the Azure Devops portal. If prompted to sign in, authenticate with your Azure DevOps organization credentials.

Note: First, you will create a new release which will deploy successfully.

In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu on the left side, click Repos, in the list of folders in the repository, navigate to the Applications\aspnet-core-dotnet-core\Pages\Shared folder and click the Index.chtml entry.
On the Index.chtml pane, click Edit, in line 20, replace <div class="description line-2"> Your ASP.NET Core app is up and running on Azure</div> with <div class="description line-2"> Your ASP.NET Core app v1.1 is up and running on Azure</div> click Commit, and, on the Commit pane, click Commit again. This will automatically trigger the build pipeline.
In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, click Pipelines.
On the Recent tab of the Pipelines pane, click the az400m10l02-CI entry, on the Runs tab of the az400m10l02-CI pane, select the most recent run, on the Summary tab of the run, in the Jobs section, click Build and monitor the job until its successful completion.
Once the job completes, in the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, in the Pipelines section, click Releases.
On the az400m10l02 - CD pane, on the Releases tab, click the Release-2 entry, on the Pipeline tab of the Release-2 pane click the dev stage, on the dev pane, click View logs, and monitor progress of the deployment until its successful completion.

Note: Now, you will create a new release which deployment will fail. The failure will be caused by built-in assemblies test, which consider the change associated with the new release to be invalid.

In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu on the left side, click Repos, in the list of folders in the repository, navigate to the Applications\aspnet-core-dotnet-core\Pages\Shared folder and click the Index.chtml entry.
On the Index.chtml pane, click Edit, in line 4, replace ` ViewData[“Title”] = “Home Page - ASP.NET Core”;with ViewData[“Title”] = “Home Page v1.2 - ASP.NET Core”;` click Commit, and, on the Commit pane, click Commit again. This will automatically trigger the build pipeline.
In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, click Pipelines.
On the Recent tab of the Pipelines pane, click the az400m10l02-CI entry, on the Runs tab of the az400m10l02-CI pane, select the most recent run, on the Summary tab of the run, in the Jobs section, click Build and monitor the job until its successful completion.
Once the job completes, in the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, in the Pipelines section, click Releases.
On the az400m10l02 - CD pane, on the Releases tab, click the Release-2 entry, on the Pipeline tab of the Release-2 pane click the dev stage, on the dev pane, click View logs, and monitor progress of the deployment until its failure during the Test Assemblies stage.

##Exercise 3: Remove the Azure lab resources
In this exercise, you will remove the Azure resources provisione in this lab to eliminate unexpected charges.

Note: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

Task 1: Remove the Azure lab resources
In this task, you will use Azure Cloud Shell to remove the Azure resources provisioned in this lab to eliminate unnecessary charges.

In the Azure portal, open the Bash shell session within the Cloud Shell pane.
List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

Shell
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m10l02-rg')].name" --output tsv
Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

Shell
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m10l02-rg')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
Note: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the –nowait parameter), so while you will be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

Review
In this lab, you learned how to create and configure release dashboard and how to use REST API to retrieve Azure DevOps release data.
